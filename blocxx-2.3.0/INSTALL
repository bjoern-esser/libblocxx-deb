   Hopefully there is enough information in this file to get you going.
   There should be more/better documentation comming soon ;-)

1.0 Requirements

   In order to build BloCxx you will need the following components installed
   on your system:

      gcc - (required)
         Version 3.3 or higher (see http://www.gnu.org).

		aCC (building on HP-UX) - Version A.03.67 or later

      OpenSSL library - (required)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 - Installing from a distribution.

   If you acquired the BloCxx software as a distribution, you have a file
   that should look like the following:

      blocxx-[Major Version].[Minor Version].[Revision].tar.gz

   For the sake of discussion, let's say we have a distribution with the file
   name blocxx-2.1.0.tar.gz that currently resides in the ~/downloads
   directory. This file contains BloCxx version 2.1.0.

   The first thing you want to do, is extract the contents of this file into
   any directory you desire. We'll assume for now that is /usr/local. The
   following commands should get the distribution properly extracted into
   the /usr/local directory:

      cd /usr/local
      tar zxvf ~/downloads/blocxx-2.1.0.tar.gz

   After this is done, you should have a /usr/local/blocxx-2.1.0 directory.
   Now type in the following commands:

      cd /usr/local/blocxx-2.1.0
      ./configure
      make
      su root
      make install


   That's it! You should now have BloCxx installed on your system.

   Note:
      The configure command automatically detects various aspects of your
      system and builds BloCxx accordingly. If you don't like the
      default options that configure chooses on it's own, type
      configure --help at the shell prompt to see the plethora of options
      available to you.

      Following is a list of some of the non-standard configure options
      supported in the BloCxx build process:

         --with-search-dir=<path to additional include files>
            Use this option if you have some header files that reside in
            a location that cannot be found by the standard BloCxx build
            process.

         --with-ssl-dir=<path to OpenSSL header files>
            Use this option if the header files for OpenSSL are located
            in a location that cannot be found by the standard BloCxx
            build process.

3.0 Installing from svn check-out

   If you acquired BloCxx from the Subversion repository at our web site,
   there should be a shell script in the root directory of the source tree
   called bootstrap.sh. The easiest way to get the build process going is to
   do the following:

      cd /[root directory of the BloCxx source tree]
      ./bootstrap.sh
      ./configure
      make
      make install

   Note:
      If you have any compile or link problems during the make process, try
      doing a "make clean" after the ./configure command.

   I prefer to do the above process slightly differently:

      cd /[root directory of the BloCxx source tree]
      mkdir build
      ./bootstrap.sh
      cd build
      ../configure
      make
      make install

   This will actually place all of the output from the make process in
   directories relative to the build directory as opposed to putting all of
   the object files and libraries in the same directories as the source files.
