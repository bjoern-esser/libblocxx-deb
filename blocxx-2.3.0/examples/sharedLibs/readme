This example demonstrates dynamically loading a shared library, and calling
functions in that shared library.

There are two components to this example.  The shared library, which implements
an interface (demonstrating abstraction) and a function to create an instance of
that class, and the executable which loads that shared library.

To build:

first run the autotools make to build the executable (sharedLib).
then make the SharedLibMakefile to build the shared library (libdummylib.so)

To run:

sharedLib takes an optional parameter of the path (path only - not filename) to the sharedLibrary
(NOTE: it defaults to the local directory, not the library path)
