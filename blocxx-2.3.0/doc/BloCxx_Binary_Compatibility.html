<h1>Binary compatibility</h1>
<br>
We will not worry about maintaining binary compatibility with the
client APIs between different versions of BloCxx, since it is trivial
to solve the problem by installing 2 or more different versions of the
client libraries. This is just an issue for package developers to
provide some way for multiple versions of the client libraries to be
installed simultaneously.&nbsp; Note that we do try hard to maintain
source compatibility for client applications, if at all possible we
mark interfaces as deprecated when a replacement has been created. They
are deprecated for at least one release and then removed after client
applications have had a chance to migrate.<br>
