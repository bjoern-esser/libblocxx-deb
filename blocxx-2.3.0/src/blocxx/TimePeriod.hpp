		 * A class representing a time period.
		 *
		 * The results of all operations on TimePeriods should follow from the
		 * following simple laws:
		 * - TimePeriod(a, b) represents the set of times t for which a <= t && t < b.
		 * - TimePeriod(dt, d), where d is a TimeDuration, is TimePeriod(dt, dt + d).
		 * - tp.contains(t) is true if and only if t is in the set of times tp.
		 * - tp.contains(tp') is true if and only if tp' is a subset of tp, that is,
		 *   every t in tp' is also in tp.
		 *
		 * Some consequences of these laws:
		 * - TimePeriod(a, b) is an empty interval if b <= a, and there is only
		 *   one such value: TimePeriod(a, b) == TimePeriod(a', b') whenever
		 *   b <= a and b' <= a'.
		 * - TimePeriod(a, b), where a or b is an invalid DateTime will produce a
		 *   TimePeriod with an invalid duration for all operations and fail to
		 *   contain anything except the invalid DateTime.
		 * - tp.contains(<the empty interval>) is true for all valid tp.
