	// PURPOSE: Normalize a struct tm, for those platforms that lack the timegm
	// function or for which mktime doesn't normalize its argument.
	//
	// NOTE: Does not modify tm_wday, tm_yday, or tm_isdst.  Negative numbers
	// are OK.
	//
	// REQUIRE: the normalization will not cause integer overflow/underflow.
	//
	void normTm(struct std::tm & tm);

	// PURPOSE: Replacement for platforms that lack timegm.
	// RETURNS: the time_t value corresponding to tm interpreted as UTC time.
	// PROMISE: normalizes tm first (see normTm).
	// PROMISE: If normalized time is outside the valid range defined by
	// BLOCXX_DATETIME_MINIMUM_YEAR and BLOCXX_DATETIME_MAXIMUM_YEAR,
	// throws DateTimeException.
	// REQUIRE: any normalization will not cause integer flow.
	//
	std::time_t timeGm(struct std::tm & tm);
